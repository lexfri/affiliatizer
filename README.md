# Affiliatizer for Safari
A Safari plug-in for automatically adding the affiliate codes of your choice to Amazon URLs you encounter around the internet:

1. select local amazon **domain** (amazon.com, amazon.de, ...)
2. enter up to five **affiliate tags**
3. **donate** amazon affiliate money to your favourite websites, blogs and podcasts!

### Installation 

#### Visit the [Safari Extensions Gallery](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=de.jonashoechst.affiliatizer-S2M4R3QVMR) and click *Install now*.


Alternatively download latest release from [GitHub Affiliatizer Releases Page](https://github.com/jonashoechst/Affiliatizer.safariextension/releases/latest) and double click to add to Safari.


You can find the **affiliate tags** by clicking on an affiliate link (which contains for example *...&site-redirect=de&tag=exampletag-21&linkId=00c37ba58...*) and then looking for the *&tag=* text (most often towards the end of the link) and copy everything until the next *&* or the end. In this example it would be *exampletag-21*. This can be pasted into the Extension-Settings (*Cmd+,* => Extensions => Affiliatizer)
